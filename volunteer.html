    <h1>Volunteer work:</h1>
    <p>For many years, I have been involved as a youth guide, working with
    young people and helping them develop important life skills. Through
    my work as a guide, I have found great satisfaction in passing on my
    passion and knowledge to the next generation. I believe that being a
    positive role model and mentor can make a real difference in the lives
    of young people, and it has been my privilege to be a part of that
    process. Currently, I am proud to be a recipient of the preach
    scholarship and having the green mentor of the year.
